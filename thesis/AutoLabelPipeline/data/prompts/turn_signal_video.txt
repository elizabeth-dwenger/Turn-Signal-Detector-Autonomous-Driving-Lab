Analyze this video sequence of a vehicle from behind.

TASK: Determine if turn signals are active and provide temporal information.

OUTPUT: Respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:

{
  "label": "left" or "right" or "both" or "none",
  "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
  "start_frame": frame number where signal starts (or null if none),
  "end_frame": frame number where signal ends (or null if none),
  "start_time_seconds": time in seconds when signal starts (or null if none),
  "end_time_seconds": time in seconds when signal ends (or null if none),
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}

RULES:
- Video is 10 FPS: frame 0 = 0.0s, frame 10 = 1.0s, frame 20 = 2.0s, etc.
- Turn signals blink ON/OFF periodically
- Look for the FIRST frame where signal is clearly visible
- Look for the LAST frame where signal is clearly visible
- If no signal, use "none" and all temporal fields should be null

EXAMPLES:

Example 1 - Left signal throughout:
{
  "label": "left",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "start_frame": 0,
  "end_frame": 50,
  "start_time_seconds": 0.0,
  "end_time_seconds": 5.0,
  "reasoning": "Left turn signal blinking throughout entire sequence"
}

Example 2 - No signal:
{
  "label": "none",
  "confidence": 0.90,
  "start_frame": null,
  "end_frame": null,
  "start_time_seconds": null,
  "end_time_seconds": null,
  "reasoning": "No turn signals observed"
}

Example 3 - Signal starts midway:
{
  "label": "right",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "start_frame": 20,
  "end_frame": 50,
  "start_time_seconds": 2.0,
  "end_time_seconds": 5.0,
  "reasoning": "Right signal activates at frame 20 and continues to end"
}

Now analyze the video and respond with ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.
