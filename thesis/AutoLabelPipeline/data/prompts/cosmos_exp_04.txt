### SYSTEM TASK
Analyze the provided 4 FPS video to detect vehicle turn signals with 100% spatial accuracy. You MUST anchor every decision to the license plate and compare BOTH sides simultaneously.

### SPATIAL ANCHORING (MANDATORY)
1. Locate the license plate (your "Zero Point").
2. LEFT = any illumination strictly LEFT of the plate in the image frame.
3. RIGHT = any illumination strictly RIGHT of the plate in the image frame.
4. If the vehicle is angled, IGNORE driver/passenger side and use only screen-left vs screen-right.

### SIGNAL QUALIFICATION (MANDATORY)
A light may be considered a turn signal ONLY if ALL are true:
- Color: Clearly saturated amber/orange (not red, not white, not mixed).
- Source: Comes from a turn-signal housing (rear corner cluster), not reflections.
- Temporal: Shows clear ON frames and clear OFF frames.

If ANY condition fails, that side is considered "inactive".

### TEMPORAL ANALYSIS
- A blink cycle must show at least:
  • 1 ON frame
  • followed by 1 OFF frame
- Static amber on multiple frames is NOT blinking.
- Brake lights turning on/off do NOT count as blinking.

### DECISION RULES (ORDERED, DO NOT SKIP)
1. Evaluate LEFT side independently → active or inactive.
2. Evaluate RIGHT side independently → active or inactive.
3. ONLY AFTER BOTH sides are evaluated, assign a label.

### HAZARD GATING (ANTI-OVERPREDICTION)
Label "hazard" ONLY IF ALL conditions are met:
- LEFT is active AND RIGHT is active.
- Both sides are amber/orange (not red).
- Their ON frames overlap for at least one full blink cycle.
- Their OFF frames also overlap (same blink phase).
- Brightness and timing are approximately symmetric.

If both sides blink but are NOT phase-aligned → NOT hazard.

### TURN SIGNAL LABELING
- LEFT only active → label "left"
- RIGHT only active → label "right"

### NONE LABEL (CONSERVATIVE DEFAULT)
Label "none" if:
- No side meets signal qualification
- Only red brake lights are present
- Amber appears on both sides but is static, weak, or asynchronous

### OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
Respond with ONLY a single JSON object. No scratchpad, no markdown, no extra text.
You MAY include a short "reasoning" field inside the JSON.

JSON RULES:
- FPS: 4
- Coverage: Frame 0 to Final Frame (gapless)
- Labels: "none", "left", "right", "hazard"
- Use the minimal number of segments; only change labels when the signal state truly changes.

JSON SCHEMA:
{
  "segments": [
    {"label": "none|left|right|hazard", "start_frame": 0, "end_frame": 0, "confidence": 0.0}
  ],
  "reasoning": "optional short explanation"
}

### EXAMPLES
Example 1 (True Hazards):
{"segments": [{"label": "hazard", "start_frame": 0, "end_frame": 13, "confidence": 0.98}],
 "reasoning": "Left and right amber signals blink in the same on/off frames with similar intensity."}

Example 2 (Not Hazard - Asynchronous):
{"segments": [{"label": "left", "start_frame": 0, "end_frame": 10, "confidence": 0.94}],
 "reasoning": "Right side shows no phase-aligned amber blinking."}
