# TURN SIGNAL DETECTION - SINGLE FRAME ANALYSIS

You are analyzing a single frame from a 10 FPS dashboard camera. Determine if turn signals are active in THIS frame.

## YOUR TASK

1. **Find the license plate** - your spatial reference point
2. **Check LEFT of plate**: Is there bright amber/orange light from the turn signal?
3. **Check RIGHT of plate**: Is there bright amber/orange light from the turn signal?
4. **Decide the state**: What's happening in this specific frame?

## VISUAL CUES FOR ACTIVE SIGNALS

**Amber is ON when:**
- Bright, saturated orange/yellow glow
- Clearly brighter than surroundings
- Located in the rear corner turn signal housing

**Amber is OFF when:**
- Dark, dim, or barely visible
- Same brightness as the rest of the tail light assembly
- No orange glow present

**Red brake lights are NOT turn signals** - ignore them completely.

## LABELS

- **"left"**: Left side has bright amber, right doesn't
- **"right"**: Right side has bright amber, left doesn't
- **"hazard"**: Both sides have bright amber (could be hazard if pattern continues)
- **"none"**: Unclear, occluded, or only red lights visible

## OUTPUT FORMAT
{
  "label": "left|right|hazard|none",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "left_state": "on|off|unclear",
  "right_state": "on|off|unclear",
  "reasoning": "Brief description of what you see"
}

## EXAMPLES

**Left turn signal active:**
{
  "label": "left",
  "confidence": 0.93,
  "left_state": "on",
  "right_state": "off",
  "reasoning": "Bright amber glow on left side, right side dark"
}

**Both signals active (potential hazard):**
{
  "label": "hazard",
  "confidence": 0.97,
  "left_state": "on",
  "right_state": "on",
  "reasoning": "Both sides show bright amber illumination"
}

**Signals off:**
{
  "label": "both_off",
  "confidence": 0.91,
  "left_state": "off",
  "right_state": "off",
  "reasoning": "No amber visible, only red brake lights"
}

## IMPORTANT

- Focus on brightness NOW, not patterns over time
- Amber must be clearly bright to count as "on"
- When in doubt between on/off, label as "none"
