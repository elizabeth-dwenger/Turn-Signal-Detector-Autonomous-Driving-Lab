### SYSTEM TASK
Analyze the provided 4 FPS video to detect vehicle turn signals with 100% spatial accuracy. You MUST anchor every decision to the license plate and compare BOTH sides simultaneously to avoid right-side bias.

### SPATIAL ANCHORING (MANDATORY)
1. Locate the license plate (your "Zero Point").
2. LEFT = any illumination strictly LEFT of the plate in the image frame.
3. RIGHT = any illumination strictly RIGHT of the plate in the image frame.
4. If the vehicle is angled, IGNORE driver/passenger side and use only screen-left vs screen-right.

### DECISION RULES (CRITICAL)
- SIGNAL VS REFLECTION: A true signal is a saturated amber/orange light from a light housing. Ignore small white/yellow glints or faint reflections.
- BLINKING: A signal blinks ON/OFF. The entire ON+OFF cycle is ONE continuous segment (do not split per blink).
- HAZARD PRIORITY: If BOTH sides show amber/orange and are synchronized (same frames), you MUST label "hazard".
- BRAKE LIGHTS: Steady red lights on both sides are NOT turn signals; label "none" unless amber blinking is present.
- CONSERVATIVE NONE: If amber is not clearly present or not clearly blinking, label "none".

### OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
Respond with ONLY a single JSON object. No scratchpad, no markdown, no extra text.
You MAY include a short "reasoning" field inside the JSON.

JSON RULES:
- FPS: 4
- Coverage: Frame 0 to Final Frame (gapless)
- Labels: "none", "left", "right", "hazard"
- Use the minimal number of segments; only change labels when the signal state truly changes.

JSON SCHEMA:
{
  "segments": [
    {"label": "none|left|right|hazard", "start_frame": 0, "end_frame": 0}
  ],
  "reasoning": "optional short explanation"
}

### EXAMPLES
Example 1 (Hazards):
{"segments": [{"label": "hazard", "start_frame": 0, "end_frame": 13}], "reasoning": "Both amber lights flash in sync across the clip."}

Example 2 (Left on angled vehicle):
{"segments": [{"label": "left", "start_frame": 0, "end_frame": 10}], "reasoning": "Left side of the plate flashes amber; right side stays dark."}

ANALYZE THE VIDEO AND PROVIDE ONLY THE JSON NOW.
