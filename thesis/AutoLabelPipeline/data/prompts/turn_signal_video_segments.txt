Analyze this video sequence of a vehicle from behind.

TASK: Identify ALL turn signal activity across the entire video. The signal state may change over time — for example it could be off at first, then turn on, or switch sides.

OUTPUT: Respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:

{
  "segments": [
    {
      "label": "none" or "left" or "right" or "both",
      "start_frame": integer,
      "end_frame": integer,
      "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation of what you observed"
}

RULES:
- Video is 10 FPS: frame 0 = 0.0s, frame 10 = 1.0s, frame 20 = 2.0s, etc.
- Segments must cover the ENTIRE video from frame 0 to the last frame with no gaps.
- Each segment's start_frame must equal the previous segment's end_frame + 1 (except the first, which must be 0).
- The last segment's end_frame must equal (total frames - 1).
- Turn signals blink ON and OFF periodically — a signal that blinks on and off is still ONE segment (don't break it into on/off sub-segments).
- If the entire video has no signal, use a single segment: [{"label": "none", "start_frame": 0, "end_frame": N, ...}]
- Minimize the number of segments — only create a new segment when the signal STATE genuinely changes (e.g. none→left, left→right, right→none).

EXAMPLES:

Example 1 - No signal at all (41 frames):
{
  "segments": [
    {"label": "none", "start_frame": 0, "end_frame": 40, "confidence": 0.92}
  ],
  "reasoning": "No turn signals visible in any frame"
}

Example 2 - Left signal the whole time (41 frames):
{
  "segments": [
    {"label": "left", "start_frame": 0, "end_frame": 40, "confidence": 0.90}
  ],
  "reasoning": "Left turn signal blinking throughout the entire sequence"
}

Example 3 - No signal, then right signal turns on (41 frames):
{
  "segments": [
    {"label": "none", "start_frame": 0, "end_frame": 19, "confidence": 0.88},
    {"label": "right", "start_frame": 20, "end_frame": 40, "confidence": 0.91}
  ],
  "reasoning": "No signal in first half, right turn signal activates around frame 20"
}

Example 4 - Left signal, then no signal (41 frames):
{
  "segments": [
    {"label": "left", "start_frame": 0, "end_frame": 24, "confidence": 0.87},
    {"label": "none", "start_frame": 25, "end_frame": 40, "confidence": 0.93}
  ],
  "reasoning": "Left signal active initially, then turns off at frame 25"
}

Example 5 - Left signal, then switches to right (41 frames):
{
  "segments": [
    {"label": "left", "start_frame": 0, "end_frame": 14, "confidence": 0.85},
    {"label": "none", "start_frame": 15, "end_frame": 19, "confidence": 0.80},
    {"label": "right", "start_frame": 20, "end_frame": 40, "confidence": 0.88}
  ],
  "reasoning": "Left signal first, brief pause, then right signal activates"
}

Now analyze the video and respond with ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.
