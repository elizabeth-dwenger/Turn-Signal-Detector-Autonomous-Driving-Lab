### SYSTEM TASK
Analyze the provided 4 FPS video to detect vehicle turn signals. You must achieve 100% spatial accuracy. High-accuracy detection requires anchoring every observation to the license plate and comparing BOTH sides of the vehicle simultaneously to avoid "Right-side bias."

### SPATIAL ANCHORING (MANDATORY)
1. THE ANCHOR: Locate the license plate. This is your "Zero Point."
2. LEFT: Any illumination to the LEFT of the license plate in the image frame.
3. RIGHT: Any illumination to the RIGHT of the license plate in the image frame.
4. ANGLED VEHICLES: If the vehicle is angled (e.g., facing 45 degrees), ignore the "driver's side" logic. Strictly use the screen's left and right relative to the license plate.

### SIGNAL DETECTION RULES
- AMBER VS REFLECTION: Only label a signal if the light is significantly more intense/orange than the surrounding environment. Ignore faint glares or static red lights.
- BLINKING (10 FPS): A signal is active if it flashes ON (frames 1-5) and OFF (frames 6-10). The ENTIRE duration (ON+OFF) must be one single segment.
- HAZARD CHECK: Before labeling "Left" or "Right," you MUST check the opposite side. If both sides flash in sync, you MUST label it "hazard."

### MANDATORY VISUAL SCRATCHPAD
Before the JSON, you must fill out this checklist for every state change:
- Frame Range: [X to Y]
- License Plate Position: [e.g., Center-Right]
- Left Housing State: [e.g., Dark / High-intensity Amber / Static Red]
- Right Housing State: [e.g., Dark / High-intensity Amber / Static Red]
- Sync Check: Are both sides flashing at the same time? (Yes/No)

MANDATORY COORDINATE CHECK
- You must report the pixel X-coordinate of:
  1. The license plate center
  2. The brightest amber region on the left side
  3. The brightest amber region on the right side
- A signal is LEFT if signal_x < plate_x
- A signal is RIGHT if signal_x > plate_x

### OUTPUT FORMAT
Provide the Scratchpad first, then a single JSON object.

JSON RULES:
- FPS: 4
- Coverage: Frame 0 to Final Frame (gapless).
- Labels: "none", "left", "right", "hazard".

### EXAMPLES

Example 1 (Hazards):
Scratchpad:
- Frame Range: 0-14
- Plate Position: Center
- Left Housing State: Flashing high-intensity amber
- Right Housing State: Flashing high-intensity amber (synchronized)
- Sync Check: Yes
JSON: {"segments": [{"label": "hazard", "start_frame": 0, "end_frame": 13, "confidence": 0.98}]}

Example 2 (Left Signal on Angled Vehicle):
Scratchpad:
- Frame Range: 0-11
- Plate Position: Right-side of the car body
- Left Housing State: Flashing amber (further left in frame)
- Right Housing State: Dark
- Sync Check: No
JSON: {"segments": [{"label": "left", "start_frame": 0, "end_frame": 10, "confidence": 0.95}]}
